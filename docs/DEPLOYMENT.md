# DEPLOYMENT.md — Deployment Notes

## Trusted Docker / Kubernetes Non-Local Binds

By default, saving `OUROBOROS_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0` through the Settings UI
requires `OUROBOROS_NETWORK_PASSWORD` in the same save. This keeps desktop and
local-network launches from accidentally exposing the full Ouroboros HTTP and
WebSocket surface without the built-in password gate.

Trusted container deployments may opt out with:

```bash
OUROBOROS_TRUST_NONLOCAL_BIND_WITHOUT_PASSWORD=1
```

Use this flag only when access is already restricted by external
infrastructure, for example:

- ingress authentication
- VPN-only routing
- private Kubernetes service/network policy
- an authenticated reverse proxy

With the flag enabled, Ouroboros still warns when saving a non-localhost bind
without `OUROBOROS_NETWORK_PASSWORD`, but the Settings UI no longer blocks
ordinary settings saves such as API-key updates. Do not use this flag on an
open LAN or public port.

## Extra CA Certificates

Ouroboros verifies its own provider calls (OpenRouter, OpenAI-compatible endpoints,
Anthropic, GigaChat, model catalogs and Provider Test) against the `certifi`
bundle, never the operating-system store. A deployment behind a TLS-inspecting
proxy, or one that talks to an endpoint signed by a CA `certifi` lacks (for
example the Russian Trusted Root CA behind GigaChat), sets
`OUROBOROS_EXTRA_CA_BUNDLE` to a PEM file holding the missing CA certificates.
The file is added on top of the defaults, so every other provider keeps working;
a path that cannot be read fails the call loudly instead of silently falling
back to the defaults. In Docker, mount the file and pass the setting:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8765:8765 \
  -v "$PWD/extra-ca.pem:/certs/extra-ca.pem:ro" \
  -e OUROBOROS_EXTRA_CA_BUNDLE=/certs/extra-ca.pem \
  ouroboros-web
```

On a desktop install the same key lives in Settings → Advanced. It covers the
provider calls: model requests, model catalogs, Provider Test, pricing and
capability probes. Everything else keeps its own trust store: `git`, `uv`,
`pip`, the Claudexor engine and its runtime downloads, the Telegram skill, MCP
servers, the web-search scraper and the browsers.
