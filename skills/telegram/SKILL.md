# Telegram

One owner-only Telegram integration provides both the established bot bridge
and the optional Mini App. The first positive private Telegram chat binds as
the sole owner. Text and photos can be sent to Ouroboros; replies, photos,
videos, documents, typing state, subagent cards, and opt-in notifications are
mirrored back to that owner.

Version 1.1 adds richer Telegram formatting, native MP3/M4A playback, and
inline link keyboards. Version 1.1.1 fixes the task-done push, which read the
lifecycle axis as a whole object and warned on every finished task.

The Mini App exposes the unchanged Ouroboros SPA through the established
owner-authenticated sidecar and a pinned Cloudflare Quick Tunnel. It is enabled
by default after owner binding and can be turned off independently without
stopping the text bridge. Disabling the skill destroys process-memory Mini App
sessions, stops public exposure, and best-effort restores the prior Telegram
menu button. Rotate the bot token only while the skill is disabled, then
re-enable it.

Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in Settings, grant it to this skill, enable the skill,
and send the bot a private message to bind the owner. No legacy Telegram skill
state is copied or changed. Installations that use `telegram-bridge` or
`telegram-miniapp-poc` must disable or remove those skills before enabling this
one.

The Mini App supports macOS arm64/x86_64, Linux arm64/x86_64, and Windows
x86_64. Only the explicit unsupported OS/architecture case degrades
independently: the text bridge remains available while Mini App status reports
that no pinned cloudflared asset exists. Invalid host runtime, unsafe state, or
companion registration errors fail the skill load instead of claiming a partial
healthy installation.

The Mini App is Beta. Its best-effort Cloudflare Quick Tunnel has no SLA and
does not support Server-Sent Events (SSE). It targets native Telegram clients;
Telegram WebA/WebK are not supported.
