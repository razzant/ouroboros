"""Typed panel records and hardness vocabulary for every review surface.

Owns what a review run IS: the configured reviewer row, the request handed to
a panel, the per-actor record a slot produces, the aggregate run result, and
the three hardness levels that name how a surface enforces its verdict. Slot
identity is separate from model identity, so duplicate model IDs are valid
independent reviewer slots. The coordinator, the verdict reducers, and the
panel projection all read these records; none of them is defined here.
